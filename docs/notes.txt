Attack animations:
    - using flags in intent and attack components:
        - attack.active used to stop movement changing transform during attack animations
        - intent.basic_atk used to tell AttackSystem to set attack.active to true and start a cooldown timer
    - using Facing:
        - Facing written in MovementSystem
        - Presentation mapper uses facing to choose between clip names
        
    - need to look into different ways to get the animation looking right other than
        using an attack cooldown from AttackSystem + attack comp, but it works
    - decide between having separate origins for different sized animations OR take all
        of the animations, put them on the same sized canvas in aseprite, and line the
        feet up in the same spot for all of them.
